## What is [tim.fish](/)?

[tim.fish](/) is my personal website. It serves as my virtual resume and portfolio.

## Why [tim.fish](/)?

Because it was the best `tim.*` domain available, it's memorable, and I think having websites that end in `.fish` is pretty funny.

## How does it work?

The site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Source code for my site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TimEwing/tim.fish); the actual TimEwing.github.io repo is just the compiled source.

## Who are you?

I'm Tim Ewing. I'm a CU Boulder graduate with a degree in Engineering Physics. I worked as a Flight Controller on NASA's [CYGNSS](https://www.nasa.gov/cygnss/) mission and wrote mission planning tools for [LUCY](http://lucy.swri.edu/). These days, I write path planning and terrain compensation algorithms for autonomous landscaping robots. 

In short, I'm what happens when an Optical Engineer (my mom) has a kid with a Software Engineer (my dad). 

## What's your favorite astronomical entity?

[Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis), because potential humanity-ending asteroids are neat.
